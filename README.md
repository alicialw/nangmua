# Nắng Mưa Nào Việc Của Trời

In 25 years time, Vietnam is expecting severe climate challenges, with half of District 7 permanently flooded and UV levels reaching dangerous heights. The shift in weather patterns has forced dramatic changes in daily life, particularly affecting how young people navigate their environment. Traditional outdoor activities have become hazardous, requiring new approaches to education and adaptation. In this scenario, where controlled indoor environments dominate and outdoor exposure must be carefully managed, how do we prepare the next generation to thrive?

"Nắng Mưa Nào Việc Của Trời" is an interactive neural interface learning system that teaches students vital climate adaptation skills through a culturally-rooted digital experience. The system transforms traditional Vietnamese weather-related proverbs and folk wisdom into practical modern survival skills. Using head and eye tracking technology, students navigate through three core modules: sun safety, flood navigation, and temperature transition management. Each module combines contemporary climate science with updated Vietnamese cultural elements, creating an engaging educational experience that bridges traditional knowledge and future survival needs.

The deliverable is a web-based simulation of this 2049 neural interface, demonstrating how future students might learn these crucial adaptation skills. The system showcases dynamic typography, motion graphics, and interactive elements that respond to user movement, simulating how students of 2049 would interact with their educational technology while learning to master their challenging environment.
